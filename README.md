# Structure of the replication package
This replication package is organized according to the following structure.
```
1. readme.md                  # the file you are reading right now.

2. dataExtractionForm         # a comprehensive data extraction form utilized to extract data for each parameter from each study.

3. SelectedVenues.pdf        # a PDF file containing the list of selected venues

4. PrimaryStudies.pdf        # a PDF file containing the list of selected studies

5. analysis                   # a folder containing exploration plots, figures, raw data, and analysis scripts.

5.1 output                    # a folder containing the working plots we used for exploring the extracted data and others figures used in the paper.
5.1.1 horizontal.pdf          # a PDF file containing the contingency tables we used for the horizontal analysis.
5.1.2 searchProcess.pdf       # a PDF file containing the search process we used for performing the systematic mapping study.
5.1.3 lifecycle.pdf           # a PDF file containing the life cycle of the automated negotiation agent.

5.2 rawData                   # a folder containing the raw data extracted from each primary study.
5.2.1 data.xlsx               # an Excel spreadsheet containing all the extracted data. There you will find a colum for each parameter of the data extraction form and a row for each primary study.
5.2.2 data.csv                # a comma-separated-value textual file created by exporting the data.xlsx Excel spreadsheet.

5.3 scripts                   # a folder containing Jupyter Notebook for generating contingency tables used for horizontal analysis. The notebook is dependent on the data.csv file that you can download from rawData folder.
